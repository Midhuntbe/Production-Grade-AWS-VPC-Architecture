# Production-Grade-AWS-VPC-Architecture
Highly Available VPC Setup in AWS with Auto Scaling and NAT Gateway Integration

This project demonstrates how to build a **production-grade VPC** in AWS, focused on high availability, scalability, and secure networking. The architecture includes public and private subnets, NAT Gateways, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling â€” all spread across **two Availability Zones** for fault tolerance.

##  Objective

To provision a secure and resilient AWS network infrastructure that can host auto-scaled application servers, with controlled internet access via NAT and traffic routing via ALB.

##  Architecture Overview

- **VPC with Public and Private Subnets** across **2 Availability Zones**
- **NAT Gateways** in each AZ for secure internet access from private subnets
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in public subnets to route traffic
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** managing EC2 instances in private subnets
- **EC2 Instances** only accessible via ALB, no direct internet exposure

##  Technologies Used

| Service           | Purpose                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon VPC        | Custom network with subnet isolation                 |
| Subnets           | Public (ALB/NAT) and Private (EC2) segmentation      |
| EC2               | Compute for app servers inside private subnets       |
| Auto Scaling      | Automatically launch/terminate EC2s based on demand |
| Load Balancer     | Distributes traffic across AZs securely              |
| NAT Gateway       | Allows private subnet instances to access internet  |
| Route Tables      | Controls traffic flow between subnets and gateways   |
| Security Groups   | Fine-grained traffic control                         |
